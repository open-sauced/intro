## Branch

A branch is a separate version of the code that's created for development purposes. Branches allow contributors to experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase. When changes are ready to be merged into the main codebase, they're typically submitted as a pull request.

## Bug

A bug refers to an error, flaw, or defect in code that adversely affects the proper functioning of the software. Open-source projects often depend on contributions from the community to identify and rectify these bugs.

## Clone

Cloning is the process used to copy an existing Git repository into a new local directory. The `git clone` command will create a new local directory for the repository, copy all the contents of the specified repository, create the remote tracked branches, and checkout an initial branch locally. By default, Git clone will create a reference to the remote repository called origin.

## Contributor

A contributor is anyone who makes changes, additions, or suggestions to an open source project. Contributors can be developers, designers, writers, testers, or anyone else who helps to make the project better.

## Core Member

A core member is a contributor who has been granted additional privileges or responsibilities within an open-source project. Core members are typically trusted contributors who have demonstrated a deep understanding of the project and have made significant contributions to its development.

## Docs

This is an abbreviation for the word documentation. Its primary use is to explain how to implement and use the product. Documentation also provides people with information on how to contribute to OSS projects and expectations for contributors. Markdown, a text-based coding language is often used to create these forms of content. Want to see one in action?

## Fork

A fork is a copy of a repository. When you fork a repository, you create a new copy of the codebase that you can modify and experiment with without affecting the original codebase.

## Issue

An issue is a problem or bug that needs to be addressed in the code. Issues can be created by anyone, and they're often used to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and other tasks that need to be done.

## Maintainer

A maintainer is a person or a group of people responsible for maintaining a specific open-source project. Maintainers are typically responsible for reviewing and accepting or rejecting contributions from other contributors. They also have the authority to make final decisions about the direction and scope of the project.

## Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for creating formatted text documents. It is widely used for creating documentation and README files in software development due to its simplicity and readability.

## Merge

Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. When a pull request is accepted and merged, the changes made in the pull request become part of the main codebase.

## Onboarding

Onboarding documentation helps new team members or collaborators quickly become familiar with a project's structure, goals, and processes.

## OSS Projects

OSS stands for "Open-Source Software" projects. These are software projects where the source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use and modify the software.

## Pull Request

A pull request is a request from a contributor to a maintainer for changes made to the code to be pulled into a codebase.

## Quality Assurance

Quality assurance in open-source projects involves testing, reviewing, and ensuring the software meets the desired standards. Community members often contribute to testing and reporting issues to improve the software's quality.

## Release Notes

Release notes are documents that detail changes, enhancements, bug fixes, and new features in each software release. They inform users and stakeholders about what to expect in a new version of the software.

## Repository

A repository is a central location where code is stored and managed. In open source, repositories are often hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Each repository can contain one or more projects, and contributors can submit changes to the code by making pull requests.

## Style Guide

A style guide is a set of rules and conventions that define the preferred formatting, writing style, and visual elements used in documentation and other content. This helps maintain consistency and clarity across documents, making them easier to read and understand.
